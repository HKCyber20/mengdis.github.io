Invited talk at the DP Technology Annual Conference 2025 in Beijing.

**Topic:** NexusNMR——智能固体核磁共振谱图分析系统

NexusNMR is an end-to-end automated analysis platform for solid-state NMR (ssNMR) spectroscopy, designed to address the critical challenges in materials and pharmaceutical research.

**Key Points:**
- **Problem:** ssNMR analysis faces high barriers to entry and strong subjectivity in manual analysis, affecting reproducibility
- **Solution:** Physics-informed AI Agent with integrated physical prior database, enabling fully automated workflow from spectrum processing to report generation
- **Technical Highlights:** 
  - Differential topology and nonlinear optimization in high-dimensional non-convex space
  - Prediction range approach to handle computational uncertainties
  - Achieved R² = 0.9669 on complex Q₀-Q₄ silicon species distribution
- **Impact:** Reduces analysis time from hours to seconds while maintaining publication-quality accuracy
