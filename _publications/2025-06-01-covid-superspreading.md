This paper proposes a novel "transmission setting - case detection mode" dual-dimension clustering analysis framework to systematically analyze transmission chain data of 1,329 COVID-19 cases in Shenzhen.

**Key Contributions:**
- Developed dual-dimension clustering analysis framework
- Quantified transmission heterogeneity using negative binomial distribution model
- Estimated serial intervals (SI) under different scenarios

**Key Findings:**
- 13.7% of transmission chains caused 80% of total infections (super-spreading phenomenon)
- Identified transportation (k = 0.10) as high-risk environment
- Active surveillance measures can shorten SI to approximately 1.6 days
