This paper proposes the first DCT-based frequency domain visual servoing algorithm for photoacoustic imaging, addressing the challenges of low frame rate and high noise in PAT systems.

**Key Contributions:**
- Proposed DCT-based frequency domain visual servoing algorithm
- Achieved 88.7% data dimension reduction using DCT energy concentration property
- Derived interaction matrix from frequency domain features to 6-DOF robot motion

**Results:**
- Completed automatic tracking of high-interference images within 112 cycles
- Achieved 98.7% image similarity
- 18.84% speed improvement compared to traditional DVS methods
