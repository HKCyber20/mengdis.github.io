This paper addresses the challenging problem of 3D pose estimation under severe occlusion. We propose PICFormer, the first closed-loop feedback Transformer architecture that enables dynamic information correction from downstream inference to upstream perception.

**Key Contributions:**
- Designed and implemented Visibility-aware Feature Modulation (VFM) module
- Developed Gated Pyramid Attention (GPA) mechanism
- Achieved 2.9mm MPJPE reduction on 3DPW-Occ benchmark, outperforming all contemporary SOTA methods
